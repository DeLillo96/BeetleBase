# BeetleBase #
## Description ##
BeetleBase is a simple demo based on `three.js` (https://threejs.org/) for 3D drawing.  
The PoliBeetle probe, after each acquisition of a point on the surface, saves via WiFi the coordinates in a Database present inside the spacecraft.  
Once the trajectory is finished and the probe returned to base, the system inside the spacecraft sends the dump of the database to the headquarters.  
So the visualization of the data as represented in the demo can be done online and without restrictions.
